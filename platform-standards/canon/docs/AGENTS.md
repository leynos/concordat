# Agents Roster (Canonical Template)

> Replace bracketed sections with repository-specific information. The Auditor
> asserts that managed repositories keep this file in sync with the canonical
> structure.

- **Operations Lead:** [Full name], [@github-handle]
- **Primary Maintainers:**
  - [Name], timezone +/-00:00, escalation via Slack `#channel`
  - [Name], timezone +/-00:00, escalation via PagerDuty service `[name]`
- **SLO Contacts:**
  - Availability target: 99.5%
  - Incident rotation: `[rotation name]`
- **Onboarding Runbook:** Link to `docs/onboarding.md`
- **Service Links:** Production dashboards, alerting policies, synthetic tests.

Keep entries short, actionable, and up to date. The canonical template favors
human readability while staying machine diffable.
